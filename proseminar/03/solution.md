# Exercise 1


### Provide sequential and MPI implementations and run them with multiple problem and machine sizes.

### How can you verify the correctness of your applications?


# Exercise 2

### Measure the speedup and efficiency of all three stencil codes for varying problem and machine sizes/mappings. 


### Consider using strong scalability, weak scalability, or both. Justify your choice.


### Illustrate the data in appropriate figures and discuss them. What can you observe?



### Bonus question: Measure and illustrate an application throughput metric. What can you observe?


# Further Notes
All tests are done with MPI Version 3.1.1
